# ABOUT UTOPIA
PCOS/PCOD is a condition in which a woman's hormones are out of balance. It is a very common metabolic condition and around 1 in 4 women suffer from this condition. However, going through doctor appointments is a very tedious task and women may fall into the loophole of unnecessary medical tests. To help with this issue we have built an app "UTOPIA".
> UTOPIA with its elaborate questionnaire, predictor, schedule tracker and daily tips helps women get an idea about PCOS/PCOD and also encourage them to lead a healthy life.

# FUTURE PRESPECTIVE
Here are some of the potential future advancements that can help improve our Project further:
- Introduce a virtual platform for users to connect with doctors.
- Schedule lab tests for users.
- Autofill the data from lab reports with the app itself.
- Introduce a calendar along with reminder system to help with PCOS/PCOD.
